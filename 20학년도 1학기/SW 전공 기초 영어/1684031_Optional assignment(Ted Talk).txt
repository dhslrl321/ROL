I watched 'How to speak so that people want to listen | Julian Treasure'

The video is starting, presenting seven bad habits of speaking
We can't avoid them in our lives, and we'll have to face them someday.
The speaker offers a variety of ways to minimize these things.
Among them, our voices were able to solve the seven bad habits.

Since last year when I was the member of the undergraduate lab, I have had many troubles in communication.
And since this year, I have become a team leader in the lab. 
So communication is important. It will play a role. 

The video quotes power by the depth of the voice, 
the volume and the pace can focus on people, 
and convey the language's intentions in rhymes.
